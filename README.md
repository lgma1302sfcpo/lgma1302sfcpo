### Hi there 👋

😄 My name is Luiz Guilherme Monteiro Arlindo

🎓 I'm studying computer engineering

💻 I developed some services for micro-enterprises with any technology, such as React Native, React, PHP.

😍 I've always been an enthusiast for everything that involves technology

🌌 I am passionate about the search for knowledge!

✈️ Traveling and getting to know new cultures are my favorite hobbies

🖱️ Here you will find some of my projects! ✨ Enjoy ✨

I have some projects to show my knowledge about programming languages, architectural designs, clean code.

I built mobile applications with React Native, developing for Android and IOS, following good practices and official recommendations in every project I work on. Through code versioning with GIT and BitBucket, I developed as a team in an agile way, prioritizing the delivery of results. 

My purpose is to develop all the projects, but there are some projects that I didn't realize yet. Every week I work in one of each.
